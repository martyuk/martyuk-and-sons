# Creating Big-Time Brands for Small & Medium Businesses

## The creative consultancy Martyuk and Sons gives small companies access to the talented minds behind many famous brands' strategies and campaigns. Thanks to our innovative bullshit-free methodologyâ„¢, we've streamlined things to make our services accessible even to shawarma stand startups.

### 1. We skip the pointless pondering.

In marketing, you can spend tons of time discussing brand values, mission statements, and archetypes. We think those don't really help solve practical problems. So we save everyone's time and money by avoiding that.

### 2. We give you tools you'll actually use.

We've been through the full brand creation process: from high-level strategy to social media copy. That's how we know which tools actually help plan campaigns, brief creatives, write newsletters, and which ones just make decks look pretty.

### 3. But we don't just supply tools, we set you up.

After mapping out your yearly communication roadmap, we'll train you on how to implement and ultimately own the process for developing next year's plan yourself.

## We're on a mission to have more standout brands out there. And if you're not quite ready to bring us in yet but want to step up your brand's communications, we've got free templates to help you out:

__Brand Playbook__. This is the foundation. It will help you get crystal clear on what your product actually delivers, what defines your brand's identity, and how to express it consistently.

__Competitive Landscape__. Before making any moves, it's always wise to scope out what competitors are putting out there. And we're not just talking about others in your category. Sometimes it makes sense to look at brands your audience vibes with, even if they're in totally different fields.
