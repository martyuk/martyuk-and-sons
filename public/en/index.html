<h3 id="1-we-skip-the-pointless-pondering">1. We skip the pointless pondering.</h3>
<p>In marketing, you can spend tons of time discussing brand values, mission statements, and archetypes. We think those don&rsquo;t really help solve practical problems. So we save everyone&rsquo;s time and money by avoiding that.</p>
<h3 id="2-we-give-you-tools-youll-actually-use">2. We give you tools you&rsquo;ll actually use.</h3>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been through the full brand creation process: from high-level strategy to social media copy. That&rsquo;s how we know which tools actually help plan campaigns, brief creatives, write newsletters, and which ones just make decks look pretty.</p>
<h3 id="3-but-we-dont-just-supply-tools-we-set-you-up">3. But we don&rsquo;t just supply tools, we set you up.</h3>
<p>After mapping out your yearly communication roadmap, we&rsquo;ll train you on how to implement and ultimately own the process for developing next year&rsquo;s plan yourself.</p>

<p><strong>Competitive Landscape</strong>. Before making any moves, it&rsquo;s always wise to scope out what competitors are putting out there. And we&rsquo;re not just talking about others in your category. Sometimes it makes sense to look at brands your audience vibes with, even if they&rsquo;re in totally different fields.</p>
